##For developers
If you're a developer yourself, and want to contribute to this project, you can do so via GitHub. I don't know if I'll be developing more on it myself, but I might. Please note that the source is only sporadically commented, and thus a bit troublesome to maintain. But, I believe I commented the most complicated pieces of the code pretty well. At least I think so.
