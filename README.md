# RopasciRPG
### rock-paper-scissors meet role-playing!

RopasciRPG is a Python 3 console game which mixes the old and famous game rock-paper-scissors with RPG elements and mechanics.

###RopasciRPG features:
* Levels and experience points
* Currency and shops
* 3 weapon tiers
* 30 personal and unique mobs with slight weapon preferences and unique taunts!
* Saving and loading
* 4 different player races to choose from
* 2 different player genders (whaat!?) to choose from
* A kingdom with a king, lordlings and lords

Enjoy this revolutionary game, which uses some of the old and reknowned Pok√©mon text in the fighting sequences.

##Instructions pah-lease?
* Download Python 3 (*not* Python 2 compatible)
* Launch your Terminal/Command Line.
* Go to the directory in which rrpg.py is located
* Type in `python3 rrpg.py` and play away!

The game contains playing instructions.

**Word of warning**: Remember to save often, as the there's pretty much an equal chance of you or your opponent winning. They are as strong as you, and sometimes a little bit stronger. So, remember to buy pots as well.

##For developers
If you're a developer yourself, and want to contribute to this project, you can do so via GitHub. I don't know if I'll be developing more on it myself, but I might. Please note that the source is only sporadically commented, and thus a bit troublesome to maintain. But, I believe I commented the most complicated pieces of the code pretty well. At least I think so.
Also, yes, the code could be optimized and be much better, but hey. This is my second project using Python. :)

###Ideas (/wishlist/maybe roadmap)
If you want to develop a bit on this crazy game of mine, here's some ideas as to what you could create.
* Quests!
* Random enemy HP, so that you don't always bump into enemies that are as strong as you are.
* Boss-fight (I've got a "boss" in each of the levels as of now, but not a real boss-fight. Just a fight against an overpowered NPC, really)
* More levels and weapon tiers
* More items
* Regions that you can explore and region-specific NPC - remember to save region information in savegames as well, then.
* Arrow-controls instead of using numbers (you could do this with (n)curses, but then it will be Windows incompatible, which is why I didn't do it.)
* Better NPC taunts (mine are strange and remotely funny at best)
* Sounds! (I don't know how you would achieve this, but it would be great. Perhaps creating a GUI that is a pseudo-terminal? Would allow for arrow-controls on Windows too)
* NPC's that you can talk and interact with
* More towns and shops
* Different weapon types than the three default
